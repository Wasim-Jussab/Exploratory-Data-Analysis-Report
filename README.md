# Exploratory Data Analysis Report

This is a Jupyter Notebook (report.ipynb) that performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset stored in the 'balance.txt' file. The EDA includes calculating various statistics and insights from the data using the pandas library.

## Introduction

The report.ipynb file demonstrates how to use pandas to perform data analysis on a dataset containing information related to income, ethnicity, marital status, gender, and card usage.

## Dependencies

Before running the Jupyter Notebook, make sure you have the pandas library installed:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

## How the Notebook Works

The notebook performs the following data analysis tasks:

1. Read the Dataset:

The Jupyter Notebook loads the dataset stored in the 'balance.txt' file using pandas and creates a DataFrame for further analysis.

2. Calculate Average Income by Ethnicity:

The notebook groups the data by 'Ethnicity' and calculates the average income for each ethnicity. It then prints the results.

3. Calculate Average Balance by Marital Status:

The notebook groups the data by 'Married' status and calculates the average balance for each marital status. It then prints the results.

4. Find the Highest and Lowest Income:

The notebook finds the highest and lowest income values in the dataset and prints them.

5. Calculate Total Number of Cards:

The notebook calculates the total number of cards recorded in the dataset and prints the result.

6. Count Number of Females vs. Males:

The notebook counts the number of females and males in the dataset and prints the result.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine.

2. Create a text file named 'balance.txt' and populate it with the dataset.

3. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wasim-jussab/exploratory-data-analysis.git
```

4. Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd exploratory-data-analysis
```

5. Start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

6. Open the 'report.ipynb' notebook.

7. Run the notebook cell by cell to perform the data analysis.
